# Hunting Saskatoon Berries

### Background 

Saskatoon berries are the fruit of the Saskatoon bush, a member of the rose family which most often grows to between 1-8 meters in height. Although highly similar to blueberries in appearance, saskatoon berries are slightly smaller, and are described as having a nutty, almond-like flavor. Due to their popularity with humans and birds alike, locating ripe saskatoon berries in significant quantities can be challenging.
