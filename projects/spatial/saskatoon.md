# Hunting Saskatoon Berries

### Background 

Saskatoon berries are the fruit of the Saskatoon, a small tree/shrub belonging to the rose family which most often grows to between 1-8 meters in height. Although highly similar to blueberries in appearance, saskatoon berries are slightly smaller, and are described as having a nutty, almond-like flavor. Due to their popularity with humans and birds alike, locating ripe saskatoon berries in significant quantities can be challenging. 

### Analysis Goal

Identify locations within the City of Edmonton most likely to contain large quantities of unpicked, ripe saskatoon berries.

### Initial Dataset and Search Parameters

To begin the analysis, it is assumed that the following characteristics will *increase* the likelihood of a specific location having large quantities of unpicked saskatoon berries:

1. High concentration of saskatoon trees. No justification required.
2. High concentration of healthy saskatoon trees. Healthy trees bear larger amounts of high quality fruit in comparison to non-healthy trees.
3. High concentration of saskatoon trees planted 6-8 years ago. Although saskatoons begin producing fruit after 3-5 years, ideal production occurs between 6-8 years of age (Source: University of Saskatchewan College of Agriculture and Bioresources).


Based on the initial chracteristics outlined, the following datasets are required: 

1. Edible Fruit Trees
2. Trees
3. River Valley - Trail Cautions and Closures Map
