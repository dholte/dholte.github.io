# 107 Ave Redesign
### Corridor: 124 St → 120 St • Edmonton, AB  
### Objective: Reduce congestion and improve multimodal efficiency

---

## Introduction
This project focuses on redesigning the section of 107 Ave between 124 St and 120 St to reduce traffic congestion, improve safety, and enhance accessibility for all road users.  
The corridor currently experiences recurring delays due to uncoordinated signals, inconsistent lane usage, and inadequate pedestrian infrastructure.  

**Goals**
- Improve average vehicle throughput and intersection performance  
- Maintain or improve pedestrian and cyclist safety  
- Enhance multimodal connectivity while minimizing right-of-way expansion

---

## Existing Conditions
A preliminary review of traffic volumes and geometry shows:
- Four-lane undivided arterial with high turning movement volumes at intersections  
- Inconsistent lane markings and inadequate left-turn storage  
- Minimal accommodation for cyclists and pedestrians  
- Signal timings not optimized for peak-hour coordination  

*Illustrations or figures can be added here later (e.g., existing layout map).*

## Design Alternatives Considered
Three potential redesign strategies were evaluated:

1. **Lane Reconfiguration:**  
   Convert outer lanes to shared turning/parking lanes during off-peak hours.  
2. **Signal Coordination:**  
   Adjust signal timing offsets for progression in the eastbound direction.  
3. **Intersection Improvements:**  
   Add left-turn bays and pedestrian refuge islands at 122 St and 123 St.

*Each alternative was assessed for level-of-service (LOS), travel time, and safety impact.*

## Analysis and Results
Using simplified volume-delay relationships and signal timing analysis:
- **Travel times** reduced by ~12–18% during AM/PM peaks.  
- **Intersection delay** improved from LOS D to LOS C.  
- **Pedestrian safety** improved through reduced crossing distance and clearer sightlines.

---

## Final Design
The selected alternative combines signal coordination with targeted intersection upgrades.  
Key features include:
- Coordinated signals between 124 St and 120 St (offset = 25s progression eastbound)  
- Dedicated left-turn lanes at 122 St and 123 St  
- Curb extensions and upgraded pedestrian crossings  
- Standardized lane markings and signage

*Final schematic or cross-section diagram can be added later.*

## Reflection
This project demonstrates the value of small-scale geometric and operational changes in alleviating congestion.  
Further study using microsimulation (e.g., Synchro, VISSIM) or real signal controller data could refine the estimates and validate performance improvements.
