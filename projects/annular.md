# Simple Annular Pressure Modelling

## Background
In Horizontal Directional Drilling (HDD), drilling fluid is pumped downhole to cool and lubricate the drill bit, help extract cuttings, and create downhole stability. The gap between the borehole wall and the pipe installed within is referred to as the annulus. During drilling, the drilling fluid fills the annulus and exerts pressure on the ground surrounding the borehole, referred to as annular pressure. If the annular pressure becomes too high at any point along the borehole, it can lead to the uncontrolled fracture of the soil and subsequent escape of drilling fluid from the borehole, known as frac-out. Frac-out poses both environmental and infrastructure risks, and is considered a critical risk in HDD.
