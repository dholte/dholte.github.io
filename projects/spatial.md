# Spatial Analysis

All outlined analyses are purely educational, and were carried out with QGIS (https://qgis.org/) using datasets from the City of Edmonton Open Data Portal (https://data.edmonton.ca/). These analyses were undertaken to gain familiarity with Geographic Information System (GIS) tools and working knowledge of how spatial analysis can inform decision making in infrastructure assessment and planning. Analyses producing noteworthy results may be used in related design projects.
